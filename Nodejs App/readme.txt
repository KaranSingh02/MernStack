Linkin Park is an American rock band from Agoura Hills, California. The band's current lineup comprises
vocalist/rhythm guitarist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, bassist Dave Farrell, turntablist/keyboardist
Joe Hahn and drummer Rob Bourdon, all of whom are founding members. Vocalists Mark Wakefield and Chester Bennington
and bassist Kyle Christner are former members of the band.

Formed in 1996, Linkin Park rose to international fame with their debut album Hybrid Theory (2000), which was
certified Diamond by the RIAA in 2005, and multi-Platinum in several other countries.[1] Their following studio
album Meteora continued the band's success, topping the Billboard 200 album chart in 2003, and was followed by
extensive touring and charity work.[2] Having adapted nu metal and rap metal to a radio-friendly yet densely
layered style in Hybrid Theory and Meteora,[3][4][5] the band explored other genres on their next studio album,
Minutes to Midnight (2007).[6][7] The album topped the Billboard charts and had the third-best debut week of
any album that year.[8][9]

Linkin Park continued to explore a wider variation of musical types in their fourth album, A Thousand Suns (2010),
layering their music with more electronic sounds. Their fifth album, Living Things (2012), combines musical elements
from all of their previous records. Their sixth album, The Hunting Party (2014), returned to a heavier rock sound.
Their seventh album One More Light (2017) was a more electronic and pop-oriented record.[10][11]

In 2003, MTV2 named Linkin Park the sixth-greatest band of the music video era and the third-best of the new
millennium.[12] Billboard ranked Linkin Park No. 19 on the Best Artists of the Decade chart.[13] In 2012, the band
was voted as the greatest artist of the 2000s in a Bracket Madness poll on VH1.[14] In 2014, the band was declared
as the Biggest Rock Band in the World Right Now by Kerrang!.[15][16] As the best-selling band of the 21st century
and one of the world's best-selling music artists overall, Linkin Park has sold more than 70 million albums
worldwide and has won two Grammy Awards.[17][18][19][20]

Linkin Park went into an indefinite hiatus after longtime lead vocalist Bennington died from suicide by hanging on
July 20, 2017. The other members of the band have yet to decide whether to continue with a new vocalist.

Linkin Park combines elements of rock music, hip hop and electronica, and have been categorized as alternative
rock,[24][180][181][182] nu metal,[24][180][183][184] alternative metal,[5][185] rap rock,[24][5][186] electronic
rock,[181][185] hard rock,[187] hip hop,[180][187] rap metal,[24] pop,[180] industrial rock,[181] and pop rock.
Despite being considered nu metal, the band never considered themselves as such.[189]

Both Hybrid Theory and Meteora combine the alternative metal,[5][190][191] nu metal,[192][193][194] rap rock,
rap metal,[196] and alternative rock[197][198] sound with influences and elements from hip hop, and electronica,
utilizing programming and synthesizers. William Ruhlmann from AllMusic regarded it as "a Johnny-come-lately to an
already overdone musical style,"[201] whereas Rolling Stone described their song "Breaking the Habit" as "risky,
beautiful art".

In Minutes to Midnight the band experimented with their established sound and drew influences from a wider and
more varied range of genres and styles, a process Los Angeles Times compares to a stage in U2's work.[7] Only two
songs on the album's tracklist feature rap vocals and the majority of the album can be considered alternative rock

The vocal interplay between Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda plays as a major part within Linkin Park's music,
with Bennington being the lead vocalist and Shinoda as the rapping vocalist. On Linkin Park's third album, Minutes
to Midnight, Shinoda sings lead vocals on "In Between", "Hands Held High", and on the B-side "No Roads Left".
On numerous songs from band's fourth album, A Thousand Suns, such as the album's singles ("The Catalyst", "Burning
in the Skies", "Iridescent"), both Shinoda and Bennington sing. The album has been regarded as a turning point in
the band's musical career, having a stronger emphasis on electronica.[205][206] James Montgomery, of MTV, compared
the record to Radiohead's Kid A,[207] while Jordy Kasko of Review, Rinse, Repeat likened the album to both Kid A
and Pink Floyd's landmark album The Dark Side of the Moon.[208] Shinoda stated that he and the other band members
were deeply influenced by Chuck D and Public Enemy. He elaborated: "Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with
their records because although they seemed political, there was a whole lot of other stuff going on in there too.
It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where
we were at creatively".[209] One of the record's political elements is its samples of notable speeches by American
political figures.[210] A Thousand Suns was described as trip hop,[211] electronic rock,[212][213] ambient,[211]
alternative rock,[214] industrial rock,[215] experimental rock,[216] rap rock,[217] and progressive rock.[218]

Their fifth album, Living Things, is also an electronic-heavy album, but includes other influences, resulting in
a harder sound by comparison.[219][220] The band returned to a heavier sound compared to their last three albums
on The Hunting Party, which was described as an alternative metal,[221][222][223] nu metal,[224] hard rock,
rap rock,[226] and rap metal album.[227] Their seventh album, One More Light, was described as pop,
pop rock[230][231] and electropop.[232]

Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Skinny Puppy, Machines of Loving Grace, Metallica, Refused, Minor Threat, Fugazi,
